# StereogramFML

The idea is to make a game using stereograms

This is also my first project using DOP (data oriented programming)

An error I made many time is bot concentrating on what is important, I would always implement a system to load all object type from file early in developement or thinking a lot about performance. This is something i'm pay attention not to do in this project, don't worrie, refactor will come later.
